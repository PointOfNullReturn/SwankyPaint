# NeoPrism Frontend Scaffold

Modern Deluxe Paint clone targeting React 19 + TypeScript + Vite. This repo already follows the architecture described in `docs/Alpha Master Specs/NeoPrism Project Spec.md` and the ordered epics grouped by release under `docs/epics/` (for example, `docs/epics/0.1.0-Alpha-Specs/`). Story write-ups live beside their respective release folders under `docs/stories/` (e.g., `docs/stories/0.1.0-Alpha-Stories/`), so grab the one matching the milestone you’re working on.

## Project Structure

```
src/
  app/          // entry App + shells
  components/   // React UI pieces
  state/        // Zustand store, commands, tools
  rendering/    // canvas + pixel buffers
  canvas/       // pointer events + transforms
  iff/          // ILBM parsing
  utils/        // helpers (flood fill, color, etc.)
  assets/       // static assets
  styles/       // CSS modules/global styles
```

Docs live under `docs/`, split into release-specific `epics/<version>-Specs/` folders (high-level specs) and `stories/<version>-Stories/` folders (detailed tickets). Follow `docs/stories/backlog.md` when prioritizing work; master specs live in `docs/Alpha Master Specs/`.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` – Vite dev server with HMR
- `npm run build` – Type-check + production bundle
- `npm run preview` – Serve the built bundle
- `npm run lint` / `npm run lint:fix` – ESLint (strict React 19 + TS)
- `npm run format` / `npm run format:check` – Prettier (2 spaces, single quotes, trailing commas)
- `npm run test` – Vitest watch mode (jsdom)
- `npm run test:run` – Vitest run (CI)
- `npm run test:coverage` – Vitest run with `@vitest/coverage-v8`

Before committing, run `npm run prepare` once locally to install Husky so `npx lint-staged` executes on staged files.

## Specs & Roadmap

- [Epics overview + release map](docs/epics/README.md)
- [Story backlog (latest)](docs/stories/backlog.md)
- [Master specs](<docs/Alpha\ Master\ Specs/NeoPrism\ Project\ Spec.md>) _(DPaint MVP details)_

## Testing Strategy

Vitest + React Testing Library are preconfigured via `vitest.setup.ts`. Place tests next to source files (`*.test.tsx`) or under `__tests__` folders. Snapshot-less assertions are preferred; use jest-dom matchers.

## Recommended VS Code Setup

- Install extensions: Prettier, ESLint, ES7+ React Snippets, GitLens, Hex Editor, Error Lens, Vitest Runner.
- Workspace settings (`.vscode/settings.json`) enforce Prettier as default formatter, 2-space tabs, format-on-save, and use the workspace TypeScript SDK.
